# PluralKit site template

Hello!

This prototype will generate a website of system members and descriptions based on descriptions, pronouns, and names provided in pluralkit.

* The site will prefer showing display name over name. If display name is blank, name will be used.
* The site will skip any fields that are not filled out.
* The site will not show any system members set to private. If you want to update your system, try [this lovely glitch]("https://pluralkit-panel.glitch.me/")
* The site has the most rudimentary CSS imaginable - any fixes are welcome ðŸ˜°

I'm still learning the ropes of modern programming - my last stint was in 1999 - so any ideas are welcome. Have fun!
